# Fitts' Law Game in Unity

This project implements a Fitts' Law game in Unity where players click on circles arranged in a circular pattern. The game tests the player's speed and accuracy, following the principles of Fitts' Law, a predictive model of human movement.

## Overview
In this project, circles are arranged in a circular pattern on the screen. The game begins with one circle highlighted in red. Upon clicking the red circle, it turns black, and the circle diagonally across from it turns red. This process repeats until all circles are clicked, providing data for analyzing the player's performance based on Fitts' Law.

## Analysis
A detailed analysis of the gameplay data and its adherence to Fitts' Law is provided in the analysis document.
